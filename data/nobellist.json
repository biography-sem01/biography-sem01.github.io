            "biography": "<p>Sir Roger Penrose OM FRS HonFInstP (born 8 August 1931) is a British mathematician, mathematical physicist, philosopher of science and Nobel Laureate in Physics.He is Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics in the University of Oxford, an emeritus fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and an honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge and University College London.</p><p>Penrose has contributed to the mathematical physics of general relativity and cosmology. He has received several prizes and awards, including the 1988 Wolf Prize in Physics, which he shared with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose - Hawking singularity theorems,and one half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity\". He is regarded as one of the greatest living physicists, mathematicians and scientists, and is particularly noted for the breadth and depth of his work in both natural and formal sciences.</p>",
            "life-edu": "<p>Born in Colchester, Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of medical doctor Margaret (Leathes) and psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose. His paternal grandparents were J. Doyle Penrose, an Irish-born artist, and The Hon. Elizabeth Josephine, daughter of Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover; his maternal grandparents were physiologist John Beresford Leathes and Russian Jewish Sonia Marie Natanson. His uncle was artist Roland Penrose, whose son with photographer Lee Miller is Antony Penrose. Penrose is the brother of physicist Oliver Penrose, of geneticist Shirley Hodgson, and of chess Grandmaster Jonathan Penrose. Their stepfather was the mathematician and computer scientist Max Newman.</p><p>Penrose spent World War II as a child in Canada where his father worked in London, Ontario.[28] Penrose studied at University College School.[1] He attended University College London and attained a first class degree in mathematics[26] from University of London in 1952.</p><p>In 1955, whilst a student, Penrose reintroduced the E. H. Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore-Penrose inverse,[29] after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar in 1951.[30] Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir W. V. D. Hodge, Penrose finished his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1958, with a thesis on tensor methods in algebraic geometry[31] supervised by algebraist and geometer John A. Todd.[32] He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s in collaboration with his father, describing it as \"impossibility in its purest form\", and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.[33][34] Escher's Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending were in turn inspired by Penrose.</p><p>As reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:</p><blockquote>As a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher's work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tribar - a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn't. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a staircase that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.</blockquote>"
