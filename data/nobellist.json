            "lifeedu": "<p>Born in Colchester, Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of medical doctor Margaret (Leathes) and psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose. His paternal grandparents were J. Doyle Penrose, an Irish-born artist, and The Hon. Elizabeth Josephine, daughter of Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover; his maternal grandparents were physiologist John Beresford Leathes and Russian Jewish Sonia Marie Natanson. His uncle was artist Roland Penrose, whose son with photographer Lee Miller is Antony Penrose.

Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore-Penrose inverse,[29] after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar in 1951.[30] Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir W. V. D. Hodge, Penrose finished his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1958, with a thesis on tensor methods in algebraic geometry[31] supervised by algebraist and geometer John A. Todd.[32] He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s in collaboration with his father, describing it as \"impossibility in its purest form\", and exchanged material with the artist M.

Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.</blockquote>",
            "researchcareer": "<p>Penrose spent the academic year 1956&ndash;57 as an assistant lecturer at Bedford College, London and was then a research fellow at St John's College, Cambridge. During that three-year post, he married Joan Isabel Wedge, in 1959. Before the fellowship ended Penrose won a NATO Research Fellowship for 1959&ndash;61, first at Princeton and then at Syracuse University. Returning to the University of London, Penrose spent two years, 1961&ndash;63, as a researcher at King's College, London, before returning to the United States to spend the year 1963&ndash;64 as a visiting associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin.[37] He later held visiting positions at Yeshiva, Princeton, and Cornell during 1966&ndash;67 and 1969.</p><p>In 1964, while a reader at Birkbeck College, London, (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, then at Cambridge)[26] in the words of Kip Thorne of Caltech, \"Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime\".[38][39] Until then, work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein's equations to be solvable explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by the use of perturbation theory, as developed under the leadership of John Archibald Wheeler at Princeton.[40] The other, and more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its conformal structure, since it is the latter &ndash; as determined by the lay of the lightcones &ndash; that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penrose's epoch-making paper \"Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities\"[41] was not its only result, summarised roughly as that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of singularity. It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological Big Bang, which he dealt with in collaboration with Dennis Sciama's most famous student, Stephen Hawking.[42][43][44] The Penrose&ndash;Hawking singularity theorems were inspired by Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri's Raychaudhuri equation.</p><p>It was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture,[45] to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved event horizon surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term black hole, leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the Penrose process, while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as quasars.[46][47][48]</p><p>Following up his \"weak cosmic censorship hypothesis\", Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the \"strong censorship hypothesis\". Together with the Belinski&ndash;Khalatnikov&ndash;Lifshitz conjecture and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in general relativity. Also from 1979, dates Penrose's influential Weyl curvature hypothesis on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the second law of thermodynamics.[49] Penrose and James Terrell independently realised that objects travelling near the speed of light will appear to undergo a peculiar skewing or rotation. This effect has come to be called the Terrell rotation or Penrose&ndash;Terrell rotation.[50][51]</p><p>Penrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of Penrose tilings, which are formed from two tiles that can only tile the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]</p><p>In 1967, Penrose invented the twistor theory which maps geometric objects in Minkowski space into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2).[52][53]</p><p>In 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S. Ward.7</p><p>In 2004, Penrose released The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the Laws of Physics that includes an explanation of his own theory. The Penrose Interpretation predicts the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, and proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference of space-time curvature attains a significant level.[60][61]</p><p>Penrose is the Francis and Helen Pentz Distinguished Visiting Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.[62]</p>",
            "awardshonors": "<p>A black hole is a supermassive compact object with a gravitational force so large that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. In 1964, Roger Penrose proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes must be seen as a natural process in the development of the universe. He was also able to describe black holes in detail: at their farthest depths is a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve.</p>",

In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]</p><p>In 1967, Penrose invented the twistor theory which maps geometric objects in Minkowski space into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2).[52][53]</p><p>In 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S. Ward.7</p><p>In 2004, Penrose released The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the Laws of Physics that includes an explanation of his own theory. The Penrose Interpretation predicts the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, and proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference of space-time curvature attains a significant level.[60][61]</p><p>Penrose is the Francis and Helen Pentz Distinguished Visiting Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.[62]</p>",
            "awards-honors:": "<p>A black hole is a supermassive compact object with a gravitational force so large that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. In 1964, Roger Penrose proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes must be seen as a natural process in the development of the universe. He was also able to describe black holes in detail: at their farthest depths is a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve.</p>",
